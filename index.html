    <h3>Introduction</h3>


    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic transformed global dynamics for years, prompting each nation to devise distinct strategies
        to navigate and mitigate its challenges. The virus's impact was profoundly influenced by the economic status of
        countries, with developing nations facing unique hurdles. This project aims to explore how these countries
        addressed the pandemic's challenges and how their economic conditions affected the virus's spread. By examining
        the economic variables correlating with COVID-19 fatality, spread, and vaccination rates, we hope to gain
        insights into how countries were affected depending on their economic situation. These insights will not only
        enhance our comprehension of the pandemic's history but also equip us with invaluable lessons for navigating
        future crises, whether they are pandemics or complex political and social emergencies. This data visualization
        project seeks to offer a comprehensive analysis, shedding light on the intricate interplay between economic
        factors and health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

    <h3>Introduction to the data</h3>

    <h4>Dataset 1</h4>
    <p> "Economic Indicators by Country" is sourced from the World Bank's World Development Indicators database. It
        encompasses an extensive array of yearly data, covering more than 1,400 indicators and statistics across 217
        countries, spanning the years 1960 to 2022. For the purposes of this project, our focus will be narrowed to a
        select set of six economic indicators, with an analysis period restricted to the years 2019 through 2022. This
        targeted approach will enable a focused examination of the economic conditions preceding and during the
        COVID-19 pandemic, facilitating a deeper understanding of its impact across different nations.</p>

    <h4>Dataset 2</h4>
    <p> "COVID-19 Daily Facts (2020-2022)" is a dataset available for download from Kaggle. It provides daily updates
        on COVID-19 cases and deaths across 226 countries, covering the period from 2020 to 2022. The dataset comprises
        a total of 184,000 rows of data, compiled into a CSV file. This rich dataset will serve as a foundational
        resource for analyzing the temporal and geographical spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, offering insights into
        the pandemic's trajectory and its health impacts globally.</p>

        </div>

        <p>To show the geographical aspects of our data, we also used a geographical dataset from Natural Earth. The
            website provides geographic data for plotting country borders and a world map.</p>

        <h3>Data Pre-Processing</h3>

        <p>The Covid-19 dataset and the economic indicator dataset was merged on country name and year. Due to some
            differences in spelling of country names, some had to be manually corrected before merging. Covid-19 cases
            and deaths were also converted to per 100k, to have a comparable variable for this data between countries.
            This was calculated using the population data of the economic indicator data.</p>

        <h3>Visualizations</h3>

        <p>Our first plot is a heatmap of the world showing Covid-19 cases and deaths per 100k on a logarithmic scale.
            This visualization was created in order to showcase the geographic spread of Covid and how areas were affected
            differently.</p>

            <div class = 'center'>
                <button id = 'graph1Button' class = 'graph-button' onclick="showGraph(1)">Covid-19 Cases per 100k</button>
                <button id = 'graph2Button' class = 'graph-button' onclick="showGraph(2)">Covid-19 Deaths per 100k</button>

            <div class="center">
            <iframe id="graphFrame" class="graph" style="display:none;" width="400" height="400" frameborder="0"></iframe>
            </div>
            
            <p>The two heatmaps shows clear differences in how Covid-19 spread across the world. Africa was the
                continent with the least confirmed cases, with Western Europe having the most. Southern Asia also
                recorded fewer cases per 100k than the global average. It is unclear whether these differences can be
                explained by lack of health expenditure and thus Covid testing, or if the virus truly spread less in
                these areas. It is also possible that Covid-19 spread is reduced in warmer climates. However, if this was
                the case, South America would also have experienced less cases, which was not shown in the data. With
                regards to death rates, it is interesting to see that the death rate per 100k is relatively lower in
                Western Europe compared to the number of cases. This could be due to better healthcare systems in these
                countries. Overall, the heatmap gives us a good understanding of Covid-19 spread from a geographical
                perspective.

        <h3>Analysis of Cases, Deaths and GDP per Capita</h3>

            <div class = 'image'>

            <div class = 'text'>
                <p> This scatter plot analyzes the relationship between GDP per capita,
                  covid cases per capita, and covid deaths per capita. There are several
                  interesting trends to be seen. There is an overall positive relationship
                  between cases and deaths. This trend appears almost in a 1:100 ratio,
                  indicating a case mortality rate of about 1%. This is close to many
                  estimates during the first year of two of the pandemic. Most countries 
                  with high cases and low deaths have high GDPs, while most with high 
                  deaths and low cases have low GDPs. This could be due to inequality in 
                  testing access and resources.

        <h3>Covid Cases per 100k vs Economic Landscape
          throughout the pandemic 2020-2022</h3>

        <div class = 'center'>
          <iframe src="covid_analysis.html" width="80%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
      </div>

      <p>The set of scatter plots compares various economic factors against COVID-19 case rates per 100,000 people, using data from different years marked by 2020 (blue), 2021 (orange), and 2022 (red). The charts suggest an analysis of how different economic indicators might correlate with the spread or impact of the pandemic across countries.

        The first plot examines GDP per capita in current US dollars against the case rates per 100k, aiming to reveal if wealthier countries have higher or lower case rates. Similarly, the second plot explores the relationship between health expenditure as a percentage of GDP and COVID-19 case rates per 100k, which could indicate how much health spending might affect case rates. The third plot correlates inflation rates (as indicated by the GDP deflator) with case rates, and the fourth compares overall GDP in current US dollars with case rates, potentially showing how the size of an economy relates to the pandemic's case rates.

        The tooltip feature enhances the interactivity by providing additional data when hovering over points, like the number of deaths, cases per 100k people, GDP per capita, and country names. This can help users identify specific countries and understand their data context within the scatter plot.

        The first graph's interactive feature allows users to select a range on the x-axis (GDP per capita) to zoom in on that particular section of the graph, and this zoom level is reflected in the other three graphs, providing a focused view of the data.

        <h3>Covid cases in the countries with the highest and the lowest GDP per capita in 2020 </h3>

        <div class = 'center'>
          <image src="barplot.png" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>

      <p>The graph presents a comparison of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people across different countries in the
        year 2020, divided into two categories based on GDP per capita. Countries with the bottom 10 GDP per capita are
          shown in blue, while the top 10 GDP per capita countries are displayed in red.From the graph, we observe that
          the bars representing countries with the top 10 GDP per capita are generally taller than those with the bottom
          10 GDP, indicating a higher average number of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people in wealthier countries. Monaco,
          represented on the left side among the red bars, stands out for having a particularly high case count relative
          to its GDP per capita, while the British Virgin Islands, on the left among the blue bars, shows relatively
          fewer cases for its GDP category. The y-axis of the graph uses a logarithmic scale, as denoted by the notation
          10^n on the y-axis, which helps to compress the scale and allows for a clearer comparison between countries
          with vastly different case counts. For instance, without a logarithmic scale, the bar for the United States,
          which is significantly taller than others, could overshadow the smaller differences between countries with
          fewer cases. It suggests that, on average, countries with higher GDP per capita experienced more cases per
          100,000 people, raising questions about the various factors that could contribute to this trend, such as
          testing rates, population density, mobility, healthcare system strength, and public health policies.
        </p>



        <h3>Summary and additional work</h3>

        <p>
            Our project explored the relationship between Covid-19 data and economic indicators, yielding surprising
            findings. According to the data, it is clear that economically prosperous countries tended to have higher
            Covid case rates, while the relationship with Covid-19 related deaths was less significant. This could be
            due to the fact that wealthier countries have more resources to test for Covid-19, leading to higher case
            rates. Similarly, it is likely that developing countries had fewer resources to test for Covid-19, leading
            to lower case rates. In fact, the World Health Organization estimated that in 2020 that 98% of European
            covid deaths were reported while only 10% were reported in the African region.
        </p>
        <p>
            There could be additional factors, such as climate and cultural norms that had
            an effect as well. In order to have more confidence about the cause of the results, 
            we would have to incorporate more data that takes into account the different 
            resources and data quality for the different countries. Overall, these unexpected results prompt further
            exploration into the complex interplay between socioeconomic factors and public health outcomes during the
            Covid-19 pandemic. Understanding these dynamics can provide valuable insights for policymakers and
            healthcare professionals navigating the ongoing global crisis.
